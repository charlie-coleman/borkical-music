# borkical-music
Creating classical music with small soundbytes, namely, bork

Uses LibROSA for the pitch shifting and time stretching of the sounds, and uses pygame to play them back to you. Currently cannot record the audio, so you have to record with other software. Some clipping at the end of soundbytes that still needs to be fixed. Other than that, it works 10x better than I thought it would.

Requirements

-LibROSA

-pygame

-appreciation for fairly shitty, so far uncommented code
